# C++ terminal plotting library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fbbdev/plot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fbbdev/plot)

***WARNING: This library is a work in progress!***

Header-only.

Compile examples with C++14 support; link with `-lm` (gcc/libstdc++ >= 4.9
required; tested with gcc 4.9, gcc 6.0 and clang 3.9). The library tries
to detect terminal capabilities automatically; a xterm-compatible terminal
is recommended.

A CMake build environment is provided which will build examples and
optionally pack headers into a single header library.

Please note that non-POSIX platforms (e.g. Windows) are currently not
supported and compilation for them will fail.

## Packing headers

`pack.py` is a python script which can pack all headers into a
single-header library. The following command will generate a
header file (`plot_lib.hpp`) ready for inclusion in other projects.

```sh
./pack.py plot.hpp > plot_lib.hpp
```

The script will be run automatically by the CMake build system when the
`BUILD_SINGLE_HEADER` option is set. A file named `plot.hpp` will be created
in the build dir. A working Python 3 installation is required.
